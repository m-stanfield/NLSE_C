# NLSE_C
A simulation code writte in C++ to solve the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation(NLSE) using the split step Fourier Method. Used to simulate self-phase modulation with ultrafast laser pulses.


# Current Progress

This code is a work in progress. While the basics are set work is still beind done to standardize units, debug, and document.
